# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to trace Earthquake data on a map using javascript, html and some css. The map textures are called via an API from Mapbox, a maps and location source for developers. The maps are casted with Leaflet, an open-source javascript library for mobile-friendly, interactive maps. Earthquake data is from USGS, storing information about real-time earthquakes, online catalog search of archives and seismicity maps and statistics.
